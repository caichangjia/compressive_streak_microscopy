# compressive_streak_microscopy
We developed a compressive computational fluorescence microscope tailored to record sparse fluorescence imaging data at fast imaging speed (>100Hz).

The galvo mirror, led, camera external trigger and DMD (usually a fixed pattern, changing pattern only for beads experiment) are synchronized through a NiDAQ controlled by MATLAB. Camera acquisition is controlled by Micromanager through Python. Preprocessing and postprocessing files were written in Python.
