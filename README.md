# Compressive Streak Microscopy
We developed a compressive streak fluorescence microscope tailored to record sparse fluorescence imaging data at sampling speed greater than 200Hz.

We controlled galvo mirror, the camera external trigger, DMD, LED, red LED using MATLAB. Camera acquisition was controlled by Micromanager through Python. 

Data processing files were written in Python. We tested different reconstruction algorithms including ridge regression, weighted averaging and non-negative matrix factorization. See the paper for more information.
